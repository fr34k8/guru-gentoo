	It tries to recover all inodes on an XFS filesystem marked as deleted.
	It's rather dumb, it just looks for the magic string IN\0\0\3\2\0\0 and
	considers those as deleted inodes. Then, it tries to make sense of
	the extents stored in the inode (which XFS does not delete) and collect
	the data blocks of the file. That file is then stored on another
	filesystem in a subdirectory, by default xfs_undeleted relative to
	the current directory.
