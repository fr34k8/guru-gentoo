  tinyxxd is a standalone fork of xxd, a slight modernization of the C code, a slight performance increase and a drop-in
  replacement for xxd. It contains the same logic and supports the exact same flags. tinyxxd can be useful in connection
  with building and packaging software, since it's a smaller dependency than ViM, only requires a C11 compiler and is
  slightly faster.
