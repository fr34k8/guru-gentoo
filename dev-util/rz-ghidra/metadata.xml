		This is an integration of the Ghidra decompiler and Sleigh Disassembler for Rizin. It is solely based on the decompiler part of Ghidra, which is written entirely in C++, so Ghidra itself is not required at all and the plugin can be built self-contained. This project was presented, initially for radare2.
