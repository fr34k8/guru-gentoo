# Per profile masking in overlays is currently not working
# with pkgcore/pkgdev/pkgcheck. Mask offending packages for all profiles
# as a workaround that both makes repoman happy and works with
# pkgcore/pkgdev/pkgcheck.
# Sorry for the inconvenience.
#
# TODO: Either fix per profile masking in overlays, or move
# relevant entries to the relevant package.mask files in ::gentoo

# Note: Use the extended `Closes: https://bugs.gentoo.org/NNNN (pkgremoved)`
# tag when treecleaning a package. The bug will automatically get closed with
# the PKGREMOVED resolution.

# New entries go on top.

# Only created to satisfy a no-longer-required dependency for dev-ruby/ruby-lsp
# Package is just a small component of Sorbet, installed via rubygems
# A proper package should build do a full build of Sorbet from source.
# Additionally, upstream adds new tags too often (multiple times per day)
# Removal on 2025-10-03
